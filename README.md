Hi Guys Myself AbhyudhPSS, This is the A.I model i worked on around 1000 hours so please support this add more to this code if you want to also please change the code before using it as it has some section like 'youremailkey' and 'yourmail@website.com' and 'importantdude' so please change them as your requirments.
In this i have used third-party packages like:
speech_recognition
pyttsx3
wikipedia
ssl
os
pywhatkit
webbrouwser
email.message
I want to make this without these so i am currently studying Machine Learning Algorithms, Neural Networking, Natural learning process  and other topics for this
There are 5 versions of this you can try out any of them.
THANKS AND REGARDS
AbhyudhPSS
