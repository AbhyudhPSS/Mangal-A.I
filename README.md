Hi Guys Myself AbhyudhPSS, This is the A.I model i worked on around 1000 hours so please support this add more to this code if you want to use the windows application of this you can download the zipped 56 mb file from https://bit.ly/3Nqf07Y here and if you want to get source code it is uploaded at the main branch i want yout to first change the code before using it as it has some section like 'youremailkey' and 'yourmail@website.com' and 'importantdude'(only if you are using version below 5) **When running it, it will ask for email key to send mails enter your email key there if you don't know how to get your email key i have made a video for that - https://youtu.be/zPkh62J1KD0 follow it
In this i have used third-party packages like:
speech_recognition
pyttsx3
wikipedia
ssl
os
pywhatkit
webbrowser
email.message
I want to make this without these so i am currently studying Machine Learning Algorithms, Neural Networking, Natural learning process  and other topics for this
There are 5 versions of this you can try out any of them. To make your own windows application first make the changes in the code then open the place where you have stored the project in file explorer at the addreass bar of the file explorer write cmd then a command prompt will open (If you have not installed python first install it) tap windows logo + r then type cmd on it then write pip install pyinstaller then comeback to the previous command prompt and type 'pyinstaller MANGAL V5.py' then go to the place where you saved then go to the place where you saved the code there you will find a folder named dist open it and scroll down you will see MANGAL V5.exe program run that.
